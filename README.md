Welcome to the Rightshero-Category project! This README provides step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

1. Docker https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
2. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) (only if your operating system is Windows) https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Rightshero-Category` folder.
3. Open the terminal and run the following command:

   - docker-compose up --build

## Running the Application

Once the build is complete, you can access the application at: http://localhost:8000/category

## Using the BFS Algorithm

Purpose:

1. The Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm efficiently explores graph structures, traversing nodes layer by layer, ensuring nodes closer to the starting point are processed first.
2. In this project, BFS can be used to:

- Retrieve all child categories under a given parent category.
- Perform other graph-related tasks that require visiting nodes systematically.
